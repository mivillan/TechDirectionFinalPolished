# How to use Locator Tool

## LOCATOR ROTATOR

* Begin by dragging the python file into the script editor for Python
* When executed, the code will open up a GUI using Pyside 2
* There is only one button you can use (super easy and simple)
* Select any object to be the parent of the soon to be created locator
* Once selected, press the button and it'll create a locator that's parented to the object! 
* The locator is able to be moved, so you can move the locator into a separate location and move the parent object (and the locator will follow it!)
* Ideally used for motion trails / animating! Can easily parent the locator and move it where you need to track an arc in animation
